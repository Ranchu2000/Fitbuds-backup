Crunches,Easy,"Lie supine on mat with legs slighly bent. Place hands behind neck or head.

Repeat.",Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum.,,https://media4.giphy.com/media/xT0xekSmUwcoD6SxzO/200.gif
Jack-Knife Sit Up,Advanced,"Sit on floor or mat. Lie supine with hands to sides.

Simultaneously raise knees and torso until hips and knees are flexed. Return to starting position with waist, hips and knees extended. Repeat.
","Begin each repetition with upper back on floor to allow abdominal muscles to work dynamically. The Rectus Abdominis and Obliques dynamically contract only when actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion.",,https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wj3zinDgbeB1cvtCB_HtN7CpuD0/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2020/08/19/692/n/1922729/499b2047118682c4_IMB_uansBc/i/Circuit-1-Exercise-2-Bent-Leg-Jackknife.GIF
V-up,Advanced,"Sit on floor or mat. Lie supine with hands on floor over head.

Simultaneously raise straight legs and torso. Reach toward raised feet. Return to starting position. Repeat.","Keep knees straight throughout movement. Begin each repetition with upper back on floor to allow abdominal muscles to work dynamically. The Rectus Abdominis and Obliques dynamically contract only when actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion.",,https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/workouts/2016/08/vupfull-1472154765.gif
Hanging Leg-Hip Raise,Advanced,"Stand below ab straps hanging from high bar. Place upper arms in straps and grasp straps above.

Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended downward. Repeat.","Exercise can be performed hanging from ab straps. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only dynamically contract if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible. ",Pull-up Bar,https://www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hanging-knee-raise.gif
Inclined Sit-up,Intermediate,"Hook feet under support and lie supine on incline bench with hips bent. Place hands behind neck or on side of neck.

Raise torso from bench by bending waist and hips. Return until back of shoulders contact incline board. Repeat.","Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum. If no knee support is built in to incline board, ball can be placed under legs. If upper back does not come completely down at end of movement, abdominal muscles may only be isometrically involved in exercise. Pectineus, Adductor Longus, and Brevis do not assist in hip flexion since hips are already initially bent. Knee flexors may be involved as stabilizers if incline is steep and no calf support is used.",Inclined Sit-up Bench,https://humanemuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Decline-Sit-Up-3.gif
Side Plank,Intermediate,"Lie on side on mat. Place forearm on mat under shoulder perpendicular to body. Place upper leg directly on top of lower leg and straighten knees and hips.

Movement can also be performed dynamically, moving hip up and down, see Side Bridge. Exercise can also be performed with straight supporting arm.",,https://i0.wp.com/post.greatist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/1.1.SidePlank.gif?w=1155&h=840
